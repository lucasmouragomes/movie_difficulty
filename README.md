# Movie difficulty analysis based on subtitles

Hello and welcome!

The main goal of this project was to use subtitle data gathered from the internet to try and guess movie difficulty.
All data analysis was done using Python and data available on the internet, with an extensive preprocessing phase.
A machine learning model was produced as a final result, as well as some insights about what features are important to determine movie difficulty.
No context information has been used, mainly word matching based on word lists gathered from the internet.
Although no Artificial Intelligence has been used in this approach, this creative approach allowed reasonable results.

Please open the PDF file in the main branch to view the report.
The python code is available as Jupyter Notebook.

Thank you for checking it out!
